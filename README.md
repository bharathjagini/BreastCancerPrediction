# Breast Cancer Prediction
## Description
> We are going to predict most likely women is prone to breast cancer based on the features selected. We are going to use different algorithms with different features and come up with solution by taking features and algorithm which gives better prediction.
## Attribute Information
1) ID number. 
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:  

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)\
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)\
c) perimeter\
d) area\
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)\
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)\
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)\
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)\
i) symmetry\
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)\

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field
13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.
